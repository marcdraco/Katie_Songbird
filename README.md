Pre-production preview of the new Katie Songbird. This contains the revised front end with 16dB additional gain and space for an SMD INA (such as the THAT1512 where available) and compartible chips.

As of this writing this is not tested and provided for information or testing by people with the necessary skills to fix errors if any creep in.
